# Credit_RiskAssessment

The objective of the project is to use data science to perform analytics on the XYZ corp datasets to assess the features and to identify features critical for credit risk assessment.
Machine learning algorithms are used to create models from which metrics are obtained which measures the risk (Probability of default) that an issuer will potentially take on issuing loans. 
A cut off will be chosen depending on the risk the investor is willing to take  and a decision can be made whether to approve or reject the loan application 

The model created should be devoid of data disparity & noise.

# Data Source
The text files contain complete loan data for all loans issued by XYZ Corp. through 2007-2015. Itâ€™s a tab separated file .The  dataset has 73 variable fields; The data contains attributes that are related to the borrowers' characteristics , platform's decisions (e.g., loan grade, interest rate) and the rest are related to the loan performance (e.g., status, total payment).

The data should be divided into train (June 2007 - May 2015) and out-of-time test (June 2015 - Dec 2015) data. You will have use the training data to build models/analytical solution and finally apply it to test data to measure the performance and robustness of the models. 

Data Dictionary contains Description of the variable fields given in the Loan data dataset.
